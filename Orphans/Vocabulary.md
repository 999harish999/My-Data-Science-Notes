1.  Function call - A statement that invokes a function with specified arguments.
    
2.  Function definition - The code block that defines the behavior of a function.
     Generator function - A function that returns an iterator instead of a single value.
1.  Function signature - The combination of a function name and its parameters that uniquely identifies it.
    
4.  Variable - A named memory location that stores a value.
    
5.  Mutable - A data type that can be modified in place (e.g. lists, dictionaries).
    
6.  Immutable - A data type that cannot be modified in place (e.g. strings, tuples).
    
7.  Side effect - An unintended modification of a variable or data structure by a function.
    
8.  Default parameter - A parameter with a default value that is used if no argument is provided.
    
9.  Keyword argument - An argument that is passed to a function using its parameter name.
    
10.  Generator function - A function that returns an iterator instead of a single value.
    
11.  Higher-order function - A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result.
    
12.  Closure - A function object that remembers values from the enclosing lexical scope even when the scope has finished executing.
    
13.  Annotation - A syntax for adding metadata to function arguments and return values.
	
1.  Execute - To run a program or a block of code.

3.  Syntax - The set of rules that define the structure of a programming language.
    
4.  Semantics - The meaning of a programming language construct.
    
5.  Debugging - The process of identifying and fixing errors in a program.
    
6.  Runtime - The period during which a program is executing.
    
7.  Error - A mistake or problem in a program that prevents it from running correctly.
    
8.  Exception - An error that occurs during program execution and is handled by the program.
    
9.  Traceback - A list of function calls that led to an exception.

12.  Library - A collection of reusable code that can be used in other programs.
    
13.  API - A set of functions and protocols for accessing a web-based software application or web tool.
    
14.  Algorithm - A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
	
1.  Variable assignment - The process of assigning a value to a variable.
    
2.  Control flow - The order in which statements are executed in a program.
    
3.  Loop - A control flow structure that allows a section of code to be repeated multiple times.
    
4.  Conditional statement - A control flow structure that allows a section of code to be executed only if a condition is true.
    
5.  Exception handling - The process of handling errors that occur during program execution.
    
6.  Module - A file containing Python code that can be imported into other Python programs.
    
7.  Package - A collection of related Python modules that are organized into a directory hierarchy.
    
8.  Namespace - A mapping from names to objects that allows names to be used without conflicting with other names.
     Generator function - A function that returns an iterator instead of a single value.
9.  Class - A blueprint for creating objects that defines the attributes and methods that the objects will have.
    
10.  Method - A function that is associated with an object and can access the object's attributes.
    
11.  Inheritance - The ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class.
    
12.  Polymorphism - The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they have the same interface.
    
13.  Encapsulation - The practice of hiding the implementation details of an object from the user.
### Nuance :
    - Meaning: In the context of Data Science, nuance refers to the subtle and intricate details or variations within data or analysis that may impact the interpretation or understanding of results. It involves recognizing and accounting for the finer aspects or complexities that can affect the analysis or conclusions drawn from data.
    - Synonyms: Fine distinction, subtle variation, intricate detail, data complexity, contextual sensitivity.
    - Use case: In Data Science, understanding the nuances of data is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making. It involves considering factors such as data quality, outliers, biases, sampling methods, and context-specific variations. Acknowledging and addressing these nuances helps in obtaining meaningful insights and making informed decisions based on the data.


### Segregation:
    - Meaning: In the context of Data Science, segregation refers to the separation or isolation of data based on specific attributes or characteristics. It involves partitioning or dividing data into distinct subsets or groups based on predefined criteria or variables of interest.
    - Synonyms: Data partitioning, data separation, subset isolation, variable-based grouping.
    - Use case: Segregation in Data Science is commonly used for tasks such as data preprocessing, data splitting, or feature engineering. It allows for focused analysis or modeling on specific subsets of data, enabling more targeted insights or predictions. Segregation techniques can be employed for tasks like train-test splitting, stratified sampling, cluster analysis, or variable-based grouping for analysis or modeling purposes.
