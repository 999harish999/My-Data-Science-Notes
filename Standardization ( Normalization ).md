As data scientists we are more interested in "How much different than the Average". 
- Standardization puts all variables on same scales by subtracting the mean ($\bar{x}$) and dividing by standard deviation ($s$).  

$$z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}$$
$x$ - value 
$\bar{x}$ - mean
$s$ - standard deviation
$z$ - Z Score

**$z$ standard deviation away from the mean**

- Standardization insures that scale of original measurement does not effect model.
