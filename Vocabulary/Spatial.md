### Meaning: 

In the context of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), the term "spatial" refers to the geometric arrangement or distribution of data points in a multi-dimensional space. DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their spatial closeness and density.

The term "spatial" emphasizes that DBSCAN focuses on the physical distances or proximity between data points in the feature space. It takes into consideration how data points are situated relative to each other in a space with multiple dimensions. DBSCAN identifies clusters by examining regions of higher data point density and linking nearby points within these regions.

In essence, the spatial aspect of DBSCAN underscores its ability to find clusters based on the geometric arrangement of data points in space, rather than relying solely on distance metrics. This enables DBSCAN to effectively discover clusters of various shapes and sizes, making it particularly useful for datasets where the spatial distribution of data points is important.
