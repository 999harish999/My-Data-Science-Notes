Recursion is nothing but calling a function within a function.


  --------
  
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. This can be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller and smaller sub problems until they are simple enough to be solved directly.

In data structures, recursion is often used to solve problems involving trees and linked lists. For example, the recursive function `tree_height(tree)` can be used to calculate the height of a tree by recursively calculating the heights of its subtrees.

Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems in data structures, but it is important to use it carefully. Recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the function calls itself too many times, and it can also be difficult to understand and debug recursive code.

Here are some of the advantages of using recursion in data structures:

- It can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve using iteration.
- It can be used to write concise and elegant code.
- It can be used to implement algorithms that are efficient in terms of time and space.

Here are some of the disadvantages of using recursion in data structures:

- It can be difficult to understand and debug recursive code.
- It can lead to stack overflow errors if the function calls itself too many times.
- It can be inefficient in terms of space, as each recursive call creates a new stack frame.

Overall, recursion is a powerful tool that can be used to solve problems in data structures. However, it is important to use it carefully, as it can also lead to problems.

Here are some examples of how recursion can be used in data structures:

- **Tree traversal:** Recursion can be used to traverse a tree in a variety of ways, such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal.
- **Tree search:** Recursion can be used to search for a node in a tree.
- **Tree construction:** Recursion can be used to construct a tree from a list of nodes.
- **Tree manipulation:** Recursion can be used to perform various operations on a tree, such as inserting a node, deleting a node, and finding the height of a tree.

Recursion is a powerful tool that can be used to solve problems in data structures. However, it is important to use it carefully, as it can also lead to problems.
