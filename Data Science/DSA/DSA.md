------------------------------------------
1. [[Data Structures and Algorithms]]: Familiarize yourself with fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Understand their properties, operations, and time complexities.
    
2. [[Algorithms]]: Learn common algorithms like sorting (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort), searching (e.g., linear search, binary search), and graph traversal algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search).
    
3. [[Time and Space Complexity]]: Understand the concept of time complexity and how to analyze the efficiency of algorithms using Big O notation. Be able to differentiate between best-case, worst-case, and average-case scenarios. Similarly, grasp the concept of space complexity and analyze the memory usage of algorithms.
    
4. [[Recursion]]: Comprehend the concept of recursion and how it can be used to solve problems. Understand recursive functions, base cases, and recursive calls.
    
5. Problem-Solving Techniques: Practice problem-solving techniques like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking. Learn when to apply each technique and their pros and cons.
    
6. [[Algorithmic Paradigms]]: Explore different algorithmic paradigms such as brute force, greedy, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming. Understand the principles behind each paradigm and their applications.
    
7. [[Data Structure Operations]]: Be familiar with common operations performed on data structures, such as insertion, deletion, searching, traversal, and manipulation. Understand the time complexities associated with these operations.
    
8. Analytical Thinking: Develop your analytical thinking skills to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components. Practice identifying patterns, recognizing problem-solving approaches, and formulating efficient algorithms.
    
9. Practice: Practice solving a variety of DSA questions. Start with simpler problems and gradually move towards more complex ones. Solve problems from different domains, such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.
