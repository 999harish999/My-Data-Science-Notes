The time and space complexity of data structures refer to the efficiency of operations performed on the data structure in terms of time and memory usage. Here's a brief explanation of time and space complexity:

Time Complexity: Time complexity measures the amount of time it takes for an algorithm or operation to run, as a function of the input size. It describes how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. The time complexity is typically expressed using big O notation.

> number of operation is proportional to the input size

For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), it means that the runtime of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. If the input doubles in size, the runtime also doubles. Common time complexities include O(1) (constant time), O(n) (linear time), O(log n) (logarithmic time), O(n^2) (quadratic time), and so on.

##### Q. If time complexity of one algorithms is less then can we say that it is better than the other? #iq 
It depends. Just because Time Complexity is less of any algorithm we can't say that it is better.  there are maybe other factors effecting. 
1. language
2. OS
3. CPU

Space Complexity: Space complexity refers to the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm or data structure to perform its operations, as a function of the input size. It describes how the memory usage of an algorithm or data structure increases with the size of the input. Like time complexity, space complexity is also typically expressed using big O notation.

For example, if a data structure has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory required by the data structure grows linearly with the size of the input. If the input doubles in size, the memory usage also doubles. Common space complexities include O(1) (constant space), O(n) (linear space), O(n^2) (quadratic space), and so on.

It's important to consider both time and space complexity when analyzing algorithms and data structures. A trade-off often exists between time and space complexity, where improving one may come at the cost of the other. Therefore, understanding the time and space complexity of different data structures helps in choosing the most efficient data structure for a given problem and optimizing the performance of algorithms.
