An array is a collection of items stored at **contiguous memory locations**. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

### [Methods of Arrays](https://github.com/omkarpawar1430/Ineuron-PPT/blob/master/Study%20/arrays.ipynb): 


### Arrays VS Lists: 
The main differences between arrays and lists in Python are:

- **Data types:** Arrays can only store elements of the same data type, while lists can store elements of different data types.
- **Memory usage:** Arrays are more compact in memory than lists.
- **Speed:** Arrays are faster than lists for accessing and manipulating elements.
- **Flexibility:** Lists are more flexible than arrays, as they can be resized and elements can be added or removed easily.

In general, arrays are a good choice for storing large amounts of data of the same type, while lists are a good choice for storing smaller amounts of data of different types.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between arrays and lists in Python:

|Feature|Array|List|
|---|---|---|
|Data types|Same|Different|
|Memory usage|Compact|Less compact|
|Speed|Fast|Slow|
|Flexibility|Less flexible|More flexible|

**When to use arrays:**

- When you need to store large amounts of data of the same type.
- When you need to access and manipulate elements quickly.
- When you need to use the built-in functions that are available for arrays.

**When to use lists:**

- When you need to store smaller amounts of data of different types.
- When you need to be able to resize the list and add or remove elements easily.
- When you need to use the built-in functions that are available for lists.

Here are some examples of when you might use arrays and lists in Python:

- You might use an array to store the scores of a basketball game.
- You might use a list to store the names of the students in a class.

Ultimately, the best choice of data structure will depend on the specific needs of your application.
