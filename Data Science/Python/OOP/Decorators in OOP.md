decorators are a powerful feature that allow you to modify the behavior of functions, methods, or classes **without directly changing their source code**. Decorators provide a way to wrap or enhance the functionality of a target object by adding additional code before or after its execution.

### Use Cases:
- Adding logging or timing functionality to functions or methods.
- Implementing caching mechanisms to avoid redundant computations.
- Enforcing authorization or authentication checks for access control.
- Modifying the behavior of classes or methods based on certain conditions.

By using decorators, you can keep your code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Decorators provide a clean and elegant way to extend or modify the functionality of objects without modifying their original source code.



### @dataclass:
for more [[Dataclass Module]]
Here are some of the benefits of using the @dataclass decorator:

- **Reduces boilerplate code:** The @dataclass decorator automatically generates special methods for a class, such as **init**(), **repr**(), and **eq**(). This can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.
- **Makes classes more concise and readable:** The @dataclass decorator can help to make classes more concise and readable by automatically generating special methods. This can make code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Provides a consistent API:** The @dataclass decorator provides a consistent API for creating data classes. This can make it easier to work with data classes in different projects.

If you are creating a **class that is primarily used to store data**, and that does not need to define a lot of custom methods, then you should consider using the @dataclass decorator.
