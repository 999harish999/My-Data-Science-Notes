### @dataclass:

Here are some of the benefits of using the @dataclass decorator:

- **Reduces boilerplate code:** The @dataclass decorator automatically generates special methods for a class, such as **init**(), **repr**(), and **eq**(). This can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.
- **Makes classes more concise and readable:** The @dataclass decorator can help to make classes more concise and readable by automatically generating special methods. This can make code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Provides a consistent API:** The @dataclass decorator provides a consistent API for creating data classes. This can make it easier to work with data classes in different projects.

If you are creating a **class that is primarily used to store data**, and that does not need to define a lot of custom methods, then you should consider using the @dataclass decorator.
