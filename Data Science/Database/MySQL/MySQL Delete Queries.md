1.  Deleting All Records from a Table: 
```MySQL
DELETE FROM emp;
#or
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name_;

```
2. Deleting a record based on condition: 
```MySQL
DELETE FROM table_name_ WHERE condition_; 
```

>[!danger]
>**Note:** Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the `WHERE` clause in the `DELETE` statement. The `WHERE` clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all records in the table will be deleted!
